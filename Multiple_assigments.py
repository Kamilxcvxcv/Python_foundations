# multiple assignments = allows us to assign multiple variables at the same time in one line of code
# standard assignment
# name = "Rher"
# age = 21
# attractive = True
#
# print(name)
# print(age)
# print(attractive)

# multiple assignments
# name, age, attractive = "Rher", 21, True  # Made the same thing but with only one line of code
#
#
# print(name)
# print(age)
# print(attractive)

# if all variables are equal to the same value, use multiple assignments to reduce lines of code

# Spongebob = 30
# Patrick = 30
# Sandy = 30
# Squidward = 30

# Spongebob = Patrick = Sandy = Squidward = 30
#
# print(Spongebob)
# print(Patrick)
# print(Sandy)
# print(Squidward)
