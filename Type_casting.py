# type casting = convert the data type of value to another data type

# x = 1  # int
# y = 2.0  # float
# z = "3"  # str

# print(x)
# print(int(y)) # this is not a permanent change
# print(z)

# if you want to make it permanent you need to reassign it

# y = int(y)  # type-casted and reassign as an integer
# z = int(z)
# print(x)
# print(y)
# print(z)
# print(z*3) you cant normally perform mathematical functions on string if used *3 it will print string 3 times.


x = 1  # int
y = 2.0  # float
z = "3"  # str


print("X is "+str(x))  # this is not permanent
print("Y is "+str(y))
print("Z is "+str(z))
