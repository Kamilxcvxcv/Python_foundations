# def hello():
#     print("hello")


# hello()  # parenthesis are crucial in order to call a function if you omit them
# the function will not be called

# print(hello)  # this will print memory address of function (hexadecimal)
# hi = hello
# print(hi)  # this will print memory address fo hello

# hi = hello  # after you assign the memory address of hello to hi
# hi()  # it'll print hello hi works as alias to hello function

say = print  # print assigned to say variable
say("Whoa! I can't belive it works! :o")  # we call say "function"
# and pass string argument and because say function is print it prints
# our string
