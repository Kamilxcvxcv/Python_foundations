# Variable = a container for a value. Behaves as the values that it contains
# String (cannot be used for math)
# first_name = "Rher"
# last_name = "Rur"
# full_name = first_name + " " + last_name  # string concatenation, space to make it apart

# print("Hello " + full_name) - prints hello + full name (concatenation of first and last name)


# print("Hello "+ first_name) - prints hello + variable (plus is required)

# print(type(first_name))  # this print the data type of variable

# int (short for integer, a whole number)

# age = "23"  # do not use "", with "" it becomes a string, cannot use to math
# age = age + 1 use a shortcut
#  age += 1  # shortcut for upper line
# print(age)
# print(type(age))  # print a type of my age variable

# you cant combine int variables with string
# age = 21
# age += 1
# print("Your age is: "+age)
# can't concatenate strings with int variables.
# if you want to display string with int variable first convert int variable into a string
# print("Your age is: "+str(age))  # by using str() you converted the data type from int to string

# Float = floating point number (a decimal number)
# height = 250.5
# print("Your height is: "+str(height)+"cm")
# print(type(height))

# boolean (True or False)
# booleans are very useful when used with IF statements, do not use string instead of booleans
# human = True
# print("Are you a Human: "+str(human))
# print(type(human))
